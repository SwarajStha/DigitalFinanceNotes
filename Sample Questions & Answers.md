# Using only the 45 sources of local PDF files and the attached Mock-up file.

Complete the objectives:
1: Taking inspiration from the type of questions that are in the attached "2025_26_Digital_Finance_MockExam" file, create at least 4 sample questions for each of the topics discussed in lecture and exercise based on the PDF slides.
Topics were: DigitalFinance_Introduction, Introduction_Banks, Payment Systems, BitcoinBlockchain, Other Cryptocurrencies, ICOs and Regulations, Asset Pricing With Cryptocurrencies, RoboAdvice_Introduction, RoboAdvice_MarketOverviewAndCustomization, Marketplace Lending, Crowd Investing, AI in Finance, Digital Transformation.
2: For the number of questions per topic use this ratio: base case number of questions = 4. So if only 1 PDF slide file covers "Introduction_Banks" there should be 4 questions for this topic, but since 'RoboAdvice' is covered in two lecture slide files 'VL7' and 'VL8': it should have 8 questions.
3: Have a variety of questions as is in the MockExam file, including MCQ questions where possible. But make sure to strictly follow the pattern of questions in the MockExam - [1 point is supposed to take 1 minute to answer], so no questions should be taking more than 8 minutes to answer.
4: At the end of the document, make sure to include the answers so I can check for my self if my answers were correct.

Now I'll create the comprehensive practice exam document with all questions and answer key:

2. **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning:** Enables automation of decision-making, pattern recognition, and prediction. Transforms finance through robo-advisors, fraud detection, credit scoring, and algorithmic trading.
3. **Cloud Computing:** Provides scalable, on-demand computing resources and storage. Transforms finance by reducing infrastructure costs, enabling faster innovation, and improving accessibility of financial services.

(Other acceptable answers: Big Data Analytics, Internet of Things, Biometric Technologies, API technologies)

### **Answer 2:** **B** - To maintain price stability with inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term

### **Answer 3:**

**Sustainable finance** systematically incorporates sustainability concerns (ESG) into the evaluation and choice of assets and investment projects.

**Three pillars of ESG:**

1. **Environmental:** Climate change mitigation, energy efficiency, pollution control, biodiversity protection
    - Example: Carbon emissions, water usage, renewable energy adoption
2. **Social:** Human rights, labor standards, diversity, community relations, data privacy
    - Example: Workplace safety, gender diversity, customer data protection
3. **Governance:** Board structure, shareholder rights, executive compensation, transparency, anti-corruption
    - Example: Independent board members, audit quality, business ethics

### **Answer 4:** **C** - Germany has a relatively low equity culture with stockholding rates around 18-19%


***

## **SECTION 2: INTRODUCTION TO BANKS**

### **Answer 5:**

**Three main functions of banks:**

1. **Maturity Transformation:** Banks accept short-term deposits and provide long-term loans. Important because it enables businesses and individuals to access long-term financing while depositors maintain liquidity.
    - Example: A bank accepts a savings account (withdrawable anytime) and uses it to fund a 30-year mortgage.
2. **Risk Transformation:** Banks pool deposits from many savers and distribute them across diversified loans, reducing individual risk through diversification. Important for spreading and managing financial risks.
    - Example: A bank with 1,000 depositors can withstand a few loan defaults without threatening depositor funds.
3. **Payment Services/Transaction Processing:** Banks facilitate payments between parties through various channels (transfers, cards, etc.). Important for enabling efficient commerce and economic activity.
    - Example: Credit card payments, wire transfers, direct debits.

(Alternative: Information Production - Banks assess creditworthiness and reduce information asymmetry)

### **Answer 6:**

**NeoBanks** are digital-only banks that operate without physical branches, offering banking services entirely through mobile apps and online platforms.

**Differences from traditional banks:**

- No physical branches
- Lower operational costs
- Digital-first customer experience
- Often focus on specific customer segments or use cases

**One advantage:** Lower fees due to reduced overhead costs; modern, user-friendly mobile interfaces; faster account opening

**One disadvantage:** Limited personal customer service; potential concerns about lack of established reputation; may not offer full range of services (e.g., cash deposits, complex financial advice)

### **Answer 7:** **C** - Manufacturing physical currency (This is done by central banks and national mints, not commercial banks)

### **Answer 8:**

**Two areas where FinTech competition is strongest:**

1. **Payments:** FinTech companies like PayPal, Square, Stripe offer faster, cheaper, more convenient payment processing. Traditional banks struggle because of legacy IT systems, complex organizational structures, and slower innovation cycles.
2. **Lending/Credit:** Marketplace lending platforms and online lenders use algorithms for faster credit assessment and approval. Traditional banks struggle due to bureaucratic lending processes, branch-based models, and conservative underwriting approaches.

(Other acceptable areas: Personal Finance Management, Robo-Advisory, Insurance (InsurTech), Money Transfer/Remittance)

***

## **SECTION 3: PAYMENT SYSTEMS**

### **Answer 9:**

**Three key differences:**

1. **Speed:** Traditional systems often take days for settlement (especially international), while digital systems process payments instantly or within hours.
2. **Cost:** Digital payments typically have lower transaction costs as they bypass multiple intermediaries. Traditional systems involve multiple banks and clearing houses.
3. **Accessibility:** Digital payments accessible 24/7 from anywhere with internet connection. Traditional systems limited by banking hours and physical branch locations.

**Transformation of consumer behavior:**

- Increased online shopping and e-commerce
- Reduced cash usage
- Expectation of instant transactions
- Mobile-first payment habits
- Cross-border transactions become routine


### **Answer 10:** **B** - It standardizes euro payments across Europe, making cross-border payments as easy as domestic payments

### **Answer 11:**

**Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)** is a digital form of central bank money, issued and backed by the central bank.

**Two potential benefits:**

1. Financial inclusion - Easier access to banking services for unbanked populations
2. More efficient payment systems - Lower transaction costs and faster settlement
(Other: Monetary policy transmission, reduced cash handling costs, programmable money)

**Two potential risks:**

1. Bank disintermediation - People might prefer CBDC over bank deposits, weakening banks' funding base
2. Privacy concerns - Central bank could track all transactions, raising surveillance issues
(Other: Cybersecurity risks, technology implementation challenges, risk of bank runs)

### **Answer 12:**

**How contactless payment works:**
Contactless payments use Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to transmit payment data wirelessly between a card/device and a payment terminal when brought within a few centimeters of each other. The card/device contains a chip that communicates encrypted payment information.

**One security feature:**

- Transaction limits (e.g., €50) requiring PIN for larger amounts
- Tokenization - actual card number not transmitted, replaced with a one-time token
- Encryption of payment data

**One reason for varying adoption:**

- Payment infrastructure readiness (availability of NFC terminals)
- Cultural preferences for cash vs. digital payments
- Trust in technology and security concerns
- Regulatory environment and banking sector support

***

## **SECTION 4: BITCOIN/BLOCKCHAIN**

### **Answer 13:**

**Evaluation against IMF criteria:**

1. **Store of Value:**
    - **Assessment:** Poor/Questionable
    - Bitcoin experiences extreme price volatility (can lose/gain 50%+ in months)
    - Not reliable for preserving wealth over time
    - Example: Bitcoin price chart shows massive fluctuations
2. **Unit of Account:**
    - **Assessment:** Poor
    - Extreme volatility makes pricing goods difficult - retailers would need constant price updates
    - High value per Bitcoin (e.g., €50,000+) requires using multiple decimal places for everyday items
    - Price inconsistency across exchanges violates law of one price
3. **Medium of Exchange:**
    - **Assessment:** Limited/Improving
    - Growing but still limited merchant acceptance
    - Used primarily as speculative asset rather than for transactions
    - Transaction costs and speed issues for small purchases
    - However, some major retailers now accept Bitcoin

**Conclusion:** Bitcoin currently fails to meet the criteria of a traditional currency, particularly as a store of value and unit of account. It functions primarily as a speculative investment asset rather than a currency. However, this could evolve with maturation of the ecosystem and reduced volatility.

### **Answer 14:** **B** - 21 million (This limit is built into Bitcoin's protocol)

### **Answer 15:**

**How blockchain technology works in Bitcoin:**

**(a) Role of blocks:**
Blocks are containers that store a collection of Bitcoin transactions. Each block contains:

- Transaction data (who sent what to whom)
- A timestamp
- A reference (hash) to the previous block, creating a chain
- A cryptographic puzzle solution (proof-of-work)

**(b) The concept of mining:**
Mining is the process of:

- Collecting pending transactions into a new block
- Solving a computationally difficult cryptographic puzzle (finding a hash that meets specific criteria)
- The miner who solves the puzzle first adds the block to the blockchain and receives a reward (newly created bitcoins + transaction fees)
- Mining secures the network by making it extremely costly to alter past transactions

**(c) How transactions are verified:**

- When a transaction is broadcast to the network, nodes verify it follows the rules (valid signatures, sufficient funds, etc.)
- Miners include verified transactions in blocks
- Once a block is added to the chain and subsequent blocks are added on top, the transaction becomes increasingly difficult to reverse
- Multiple copies of the blockchain exist across the network, ensuring transparency and preventing fraud


### **Answer 16:** **B** - The proof-of-work mining process consumes enormous amounts of energy (comparable to small countries' annual electricity consumption)


***

## **SECTION 5: OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES**

### **Answer 17:**

**Proof-of-Work (PoW):**

- **How it works:** Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles; first to solve adds the block and receives rewards
- **Advantage:** Proven security track record; 51% attack requires controlling majority of computing power (expensive)
- **Disadvantage:** Extremely energy-intensive; limited transaction throughput; high environmental impact

**Proof-of-Stake (PoS):**

- **How it works:** Validators "stake" (lock up) cryptocurrency as collateral; validators are chosen to create blocks based on their stake size
- **Advantage:** 99%+ more energy efficient; faster transaction processing; lower barriers to participation
- **Disadvantage:** Less proven security model; "rich get richer" dynamics; requires trust in validators


### **Answer 18:**

**Smart contracts** are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code on the Ethereum blockchain. They automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without intermediaries.

**Real-world example:**

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Automated lending protocols where users can lend/borrow funds. Smart contract automatically calculates interest, liquidates collateral if needed, and distributes payments without a bank.
- **Insurance:** Flight delay insurance that automatically pays out if flight tracking data shows a delay.
- **Supply chain:** Automatic payment release when goods are delivered and confirmed via IoT sensors.


### **Answer 19:** **B** - They are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to fiat currencies (e.g., 1 USDT = 1 USD)

### **Answer 20:**

**Pegging mechanisms:**

1. **Fiat-Collateralized:**
    - Issuer holds USD (or other fiat) reserves backing each token 1:1
    - Examples: USDT (Tether), USDC
    - Risk: Reserve transparency - are assets really there? Custodian risk, regulatory seizure risk
2. **Crypto-Collateralized:**
    - Backed by volatile crypto assets locked in smart contracts
    - Over-collateralized (e.g., \$150 of ETH backs \$100 of stablecoin)
    - Example: DAI
    - Risk: Collateral volatility can trigger liquidation cascades; smart contract bugs; oracle failure
3. **Algorithmic:**
    - Uses algorithms to expand/contract supply to maintain peg; little or no reserves
    - Example: TerraUSD (UST) - collapsed in 2022
    - Risk: No hard backing; vulnerable to death spirals if confidence is lost; bank run dynamics

***

## **SECTION 6: ICOS AND REGULATIONS**

### **Answer 21:**

**Initial Coin Offering (ICO):** A fundraising mechanism where ventures sell digital tokens to investors in exchange for cryptocurrency (usually) or fiat money.

**Three key differences from IPOs:**

1. **Regulation:**
    - IPOs: Heavily regulated, require SEC registration (US) or equivalent, extensive disclosure requirements, legal obligations
    - ICOs: Largely unregulated or lightly regulated; minimal disclosure requirements; often just a whitepaper
2. **Investor Protection:**
    - IPOs: Strong investor protections, company audits, prospectus requirements, securities laws apply
    - ICOs: Minimal investor protection; high fraud risk; no standardized disclosure; tokens often don't represent equity or legal claims
3. **Market Structure:**
    - IPOs: Conducted through established underwriters and exchanges; shares represent ownership
    - ICOs: Direct-to-consumer via blockchain; tokens may be utility, security, or currency; global accessibility; lower barriers to entry

(Other acceptable differences: Cost of issuance, speed, ownership rights, secondary markets)

### **Answer 22:** **B** - When there is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits from the efforts of others

### **Answer 23:**

**EU - MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) Regulation:**

**Main objectives:**

- Establish comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets not covered by existing EU financial law
- Protect consumers and investors
- Ensure market integrity and financial stability
- Prevent market manipulation and money laundering

**Three specific requirements:**

1. **Authorization Requirements:** Crypto-asset service providers must obtain authorization from national regulators to operate
2. **Reserve Requirements for Stablecoins:** Issuers of asset-referenced tokens must maintain adequate reserves and meet strict liquidity requirements
3. **Client Asset Segregation:** Firms must ring-fence client assets from their own balance sheets (lesson from FTX collapse)

(Other provisions: Market abuse rules, transparency requirements, operational resilience standards)

**USA - GENIUS Act:**

**Main objectives:**

- Establish first comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins
- Ensure consumer protection through reserve backing
- Create clear regulatory standards

**Three specific requirements:**

1. **1:1 Backing Requirement:** Stablecoins must be fully backed by US dollars or highly liquid assets
2. **Issuer Licensing:** Only approved institutions (insured depositories, federally/state-qualified issuers) can issue stablecoins
3. **Redemption Rights:** Issuers must redeem stablecoins at par on demand; holders have priority claims on reserves in insolvency

### **Answer 24:** **B** - Establishing comprehensive rules for crypto-assets not yet regulated under EU financial law


***

## **SECTION 7: ASSET PRICING WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES**

### **Answer 25:**

**"Pushed" Hypothesis (Griffin \& Shams 2020):**

The pushed hypothesis suggests that Tether is printed/issued regardless of actual demand from cash investors, and this unbacked supply is used to purchase Bitcoin, artificially inflating its price.

**Evidence supporting the hypothesis:**

1. **Timing of Flows:** Tether flows from Bitfinex to other exchanges (Poloniex, Bittrex) systematically occurred after Bitcoin price drops, followed by Bitcoin price increases
2. **Concentration:** Approximately 50% of Tether-Bitcoin exchange was driven by one large account (1LSg), not diverse investor demand
3. **End-of-Month Effects:** Bitcoin prices declined at month-ends when Tether issuance was high - consistent with liquidating Bitcoin to show reserves for accounting statements
4. **Below-Round-Number Buying:** Heavy Bitcoin buying just below psychological price levels (\$500 increments) during Tether authorization periods - consistent with price support strategy
5. **Reserve Insufficiency:** Patterns suggested Tether reserves were insufficient before month-ends, requiring Bitcoin liquidation

**Implication:** Rather than genuine investor demand, price patterns consistent with strategic market manipulation using unbacked money.

### **Answer 26:**

**Sharpe Ratio Calculation:**

Formula: Sharpe Ratio = (Average Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation

Calculation:

- Average Return = 15% = 0.15
- Risk-Free Rate = 0.1% = 0.001
- Standard Deviation = 45% = 0.45

Sharpe Ratio = (0.15 - 0.001) / 0.45 = 0.149 / 0.45 = **0.331**

**Interpretation:**
A Sharpe Ratio of 0.331 indicates that for every unit of risk (standard deviation) taken, the investor receives approximately 0.33 units of excess return above the risk-free rate. This is relatively low compared to traditional investments (where >1.0 is considered good), reflecting Bitcoin's high volatility relative to its return. The low ratio suggests poor risk-adjusted performance during this period.

### **Answer 27:** **C** - Approximately 25-26% (one-quarter of Bitcoin users)

### **Answer 28:**

**Factors contributing to Bitcoin volatility:**

1. **Limited liquidity and market depth:**
    - Relatively small market compared to traditional assets
    - Large trades can cause significant price movements
    - Concentrated ownership (whales can move markets)
    - **Implication:** Susceptible to price manipulation; risky for institutional investors
2. **Speculation and sentiment-driven trading:**
    - No underlying cash flows or assets to anchor valuation
    - Price driven by supply/demand dynamics and sentiment
    - High retail participation with emotional trading
    - Media coverage and social media can trigger rapid price swings
    - **Implication:** Price can deviate far from any fundamental value; bubble-like behavior

(Other acceptable factors: Regulatory uncertainty, exchange failures/hacks, lack of derivatives for hedging, immature market infrastructure)

## **SECTION 8: ROBO-ADVICE INTRODUCTION**

### **Answer 29:**

**Robo-Advisors** are automated digital platforms that provide algorithm-driven financial planning and investment management services with minimal human intervention.

**Three differences from traditional financial advisors:**

1. **Service Delivery:**
    - Robo: Fully automated via algorithms; questionnaire-based risk assessment; digital interface only
    - Traditional: Face-to-face meetings; personalized discussions; human judgment and expertise
2. **Cost Structure:**
    - Robo: Low fees (typically 0.25%-0.5% annually); no minimum investments or low minimums
    - Traditional: Higher fees (1%-2%+ annually); often high minimum investment requirements; potentially commission-based
3. **Client Interaction:**
    - Robo: Limited or no human interaction; standardized advice; self-service model
    - Traditional: Ongoing personal relationship; customized advice for complex situations; holistic financial planning

### **Answer 30:** **C** - Robo-advisors charge 0.25-0.5% annually, traditional advisors charge 1-2% or more

### **Answer 31:**

**Smart Beta** investing uses rule-based strategies to select and weight securities based on factors other than market capitalization (e.g., value, momentum, quality, low volatility).

**Arguments for PASSIVE classification:**

- Rules-based approach with transparent methodology
- No active manager making discretionary decisions
- Systematic rebalancing according to predetermined rules
- Lower fees than traditional active management
- Does not try to time markets or pick individual stocks

**Arguments for ACTIVE classification:**

- Deviates from market-cap weighting (benchmark)
- Requires strategic choices about which factors to target
- Attempts to outperform market-cap weighted indexes
- Factor selection and weighting involve active decisions
- Performance depends on factor timing (which factors work when)

**Conclusion:** Smart beta sits between passive and active - it's "systematically active" or "passive-plus." It's more active than pure indexing but more passive than traditional active management.

### **Answer 32:** **C** - Face-to-face meetings with financial planners (Robo-advisors are digital-only with minimal or no human interaction)

## **SECTION 9: ROBO-ADVICE MARKET \& CUSTOMIZATION**

### **Answer 33:**

**Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH):** Markets are informationally efficient - prices reflect all available information, making it impossible to consistently achieve above-market returns through analysis or trading strategies.

**What anomalies mean for EMH validity:**

Market anomalies are patterns in returns that violate EMH predictions. Their existence suggests markets are not fully efficient and that systematic strategies can generate excess returns.

**Impact on EMH:**

- Challenges strong-form efficiency
- Suggests information is not instantaneously incorporated into prices
- Indicates behavioral biases or market frictions exist
- However, some argue anomalies disappear after discovery (McLean \& Pontiff 2016)

**Two well-known anomalies:**

1. **Momentum Effect:**
    - Stocks that performed well in the past continue to outperform in the short-term (3-12 months)
    - Violates EMH: Past returns should not predict future returns
    - **Robo-advisor exploitation:** Systematically buy recent winners, sell recent losers; momentum factor in portfolio construction
2. **Value Effect:**
    - Stocks with low price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios outperform growth stocks over long periods
    - Violates EMH: Market misprices stocks based on fundamentals
    - **Robo-advisor exploitation:** Overweight value stocks; factor-based tilts toward undervalued securities

(Other acceptable anomalies: Size effect, low volatility anomaly, profitability factor, January effect, post-earnings announcement drift)

### **Answer 34:**

**Factor investing** is an investment approach that targets specific drivers of return across asset classes. Robo-advisors use factor-based strategies to build portfolios that capture systematic risk premiums.

**Three common factors:**

1. **Value:** Stocks that appear cheap relative to fundamentals (e.g., low P/E, low P/B ratios) tend to outperform. Based on mean reversion and market overreaction.
2. **Momentum:** Securities that have performed well recently tend to continue performing well in the near term (3-12 months). Based on behavioral biases like herding and underreaction.
3. **Size (Small Cap):** Smaller companies tend to outperform larger companies over long periods. May reflect higher risk, lower liquidity, or market inefficiencies.
4. **Quality:** Companies with strong profitability, low debt, and stable earnings tend to outperform. Reflects fundamental business strength.
5. **Low Volatility:** Lower-risk stocks often deliver returns similar to or better than high-risk stocks, violating traditional risk-return relationship.

### **Answer 35:** **C** - It declines (post-publication returns are lower than in-sample returns, due to combination of statistical bias and publication-informed trading)

### **Answer 36:**

**Customization capabilities of modern robo-advisors:**

**Risk Tolerance Integration:**

- Questionnaires assess investor risk appetite, time horizon, and financial goals
- Algorithm adjusts asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) to match risk profile
- Dynamic adjustment as investor circumstances change

**ESG Preferences:**

- Screening options to exclude certain industries (e.g., tobacco, weapons, fossil fuels)
- Positive screening to include ESG-focused funds or companies
- Impact investing options aligned with values
- ESG scoring integration in portfolio construction

**Other customization:**

- Tax optimization (tax-loss harvesting, tax-efficient fund selection)
- Goal-based investing (retirement, home purchase, education)
- Income needs and liquidity preferences
- Socially responsible investing themes
- Religious/ethical restrictions (e.g., Sharia-compliant investing)

**Implementation:**
Robo-advisors use algorithms that take these preferences as inputs and construct portfolios from a universe of ETFs/funds that match the criteria while maintaining diversification and cost efficiency.

***

## **SECTION 10: MARKETPLACE LENDING**

### **Answer 37:**

**Marketplace Lending (Peer-to-Peer Lending) Business Model:**

**Structure:**

- **Borrowers:** Apply for loans directly on platform; complete application and credit assessment online
- **Lenders/Investors:** Browse loan opportunities; can invest in parts of multiple loans to diversify; earn interest returns
- **Platform:** Acts as intermediary; matches borrowers with lenders; provides technology for credit assessment, loan servicing, and payments; charges origination fees

**Differences from traditional banks:**

1. **Credit Assessment:**
    - Marketplace: Algorithm-driven using alternative data (e.g., cash flow patterns, online behavior, social data); faster approval
    - Banks: Manual underwriting; traditional credit scores; longer approval process
2. **Risk Management:**
    - Marketplace: Investors bear credit risk directly; can diversify across many loans; transparent risk grades
    - Banks: Bank bears credit risk; diversification through loan portfolio; regulatory capital requirements
3. **Funding Source:**
    - Marketplace: Funded by individual and institutional investors on platform; not deposit-funded
    - Banks: Funded by customer deposits (fractional reserve banking)
4. **Cost Structure:**
    - Marketplace: Lower overhead (no branches); technology-driven; can offer competitive rates
    - Banks: High fixed costs (branches, staff); regulatory compliance costs

### **Answer 38:**

**Two reasons for IPO timing in bullish markets:**

1. **Higher Valuations:**
    - During bull markets, investor optimism leads to higher price-to-earnings ratios and valuations
    - Companies can raise more capital at better terms
    - Existing shareholders (founders, VCs) can exit at higher prices
    - Market sentiment favors growth stories
2. **Stronger Investor Demand:**
    - Bull markets attract more retail and institutional capital to equity markets
    - Investors more willing to take risks on new issues
    - Higher trading volumes and liquidity
    - Better chances of successful IPO completion (avoiding withdrawn offerings)
    - Positive momentum carries into secondary market trading (less underpricing needed)

(Other acceptable answers: Media attention more positive, comparable companies trading well creates favorable comparisons, underwriters more confident)

### **Answer 39:** **B** - They can offer faster loan approval through algorithmic assessment (decisions in hours/days vs. weeks)

### **Answer 40:**

**Credit scoring algorithms in marketplace lending:**

Marketplace lending platforms use machine learning algorithms that go beyond traditional credit scores (FICO) to assess creditworthiness.

**Differences from traditional scoring:**

- Incorporate many more variables (100s vs. handful)
- Can identify complex, non-linear relationships
- Update models more frequently with new data
- Better at assessing thin-file or no-file borrowers
- Predictive rather than purely backward-looking

**Data sources incorporated:**

- Traditional: Credit bureau data, income verification, employment history
- Alternative data:
    - Bank account cash flow patterns (spending, savings behavior)
    - Utility and rent payment history
    - Education and employment data (LinkedIn)
    - Online behavior and digital footprint
    - Social media data (connections, activity)
    - Psychometric testing
    - Mobile phone usage patterns

**Advantages:** Faster decisions, can serve underbanked populations, potentially more accurate

**Concerns:** Potential bias, privacy issues, explainability challenges

***

## **SECTION 11: CROWD INVESTING**

### **Answer 41:**

**Business Angels vs. Venture Capital Firms:**


| Dimension | Business Angels | Venture Capital Firms |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Investment Size** | Smaller (typically €25k-€500k) | Larger (€1M-€50M+) |
| **Stage** | Very early (seed, pre-seed) | Later seed, Series A, B, C |
| **Value-Added** | Personal mentorship, network access, industry experience | Professional governance, strategic guidance, extensive network, recruitment help |
| **Decision Process** | Individual/small group; faster; more flexible | Committee-based; due diligence intensive; slower |
| **Investment Terms** | More flexible, less demanding | Formal term sheets, board seats, liquidation preferences, anti-dilution |
| **Time Horizon** | Flexible, longer-term | Defined fund life (7-10 years), pressure for exits |
| **Involvement** | Hands-on, advisory role | Active board participation, monitoring |

**As a startup founder, preference depends on stage:**

**Would choose Business Angel if:**

- Very early stage with just an idea or prototype
- Need quick funding decisions
- Value hands-on mentorship and personal relationships
- Want to maintain more control (less dilution)
- Need flexibility in terms

**Would choose VC if:**

- Ready to scale with proven business model
- Need substantial capital for growth
- Benefit from professional governance and networks
- Seeking validation from established investors (signaling effect)
- Can accept more stringent terms for larger capital

**Personal choice explanation should include:**

- Assessment of company's stage and capital needs
- Trade-offs between control and resources
- Value placed on specific expertise vs. capital


### **Answer 42:** **C** - Equity crowdfunding (crowdinvesting)

### **Answer 43:**

**Three main risks of equity crowdfunding for investors:**

1. **High Failure Rate / Illiquidity:**
    - Most startups fail (70-90% within 5 years)
    - No public market for shares - extremely difficult to exit investment
    - Capital may be locked up for 5-10+ years or permanently lost
    - Valuation uncertainty
2. **Information Asymmetry:**
    - Limited information disclosure compared to public companies
    - No audited financials in many cases
    - Difficulty assessing business viability
    - Potential for fraud or misrepresentation
    - Lack of transparency about business operations
3. **Dilution Risk:**
    - Future financing rounds may heavily dilute early investors
    - No anti-dilution protection for crowd investors
    - Professional investors (VCs) may negotiate better terms
    - Liquidation preferences may leave crowd investors with nothing

(Other acceptable risks: Lack of investor protections, no voting rights, regulatory uncertainty, platform risk, selection bias)

### **Answer 44:**

**Signaling in crowdfunding campaigns:**

Signals are observable actions or characteristics that credibly convey information about venture quality, helping investors overcome information asymmetry.

**Two credible signals:**

1. **Founder Financial Commitment / Equity Retention:**
    - Founders investing their own money or retaining significant equity
    - **Why effective:** Demonstrates "skin in the game"; founders have more to lose if venture fails; aligns incentives; costly to fake
    - Separates committed entrepreneurs from those looking for quick cash
2. **Third-Party Endorsements:**
    - Backing from established VCs, angel investors, or accelerators
    - Patents, awards, or certifications
    - Media coverage from credible sources
    - **Why effective:** Independent validation of quality; these parties have conducted due diligence; reputation at stake; difficult to manipulate
    - Particularly valuable coming from sophisticated investors who have something to lose

(Other acceptable signals: Prior successful exits, educational credentials from top institutions, functioning prototype/product, customer traction, strategic partnerships, professional business plan quality)

## **SECTION 12: AI IN FINANCE**

### **Answer 45:**

**Definitions and relationships:**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**

- Broadest concept: Technology enabling computers to simulate human intelligence, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making
- Example in finance: Fraud detection systems that identify unusual transaction patterns

**Machine Learning (ML):**

- Subset of AI: Uses data and algorithms to enable systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming
- Example in finance: Credit scoring models that learn from historical loan performance data

**Deep Learning (DL):**

- Subset of ML: Uses multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns in data; mimics human brain structure
- Example in finance: Image recognition for processing documents (e.g., ID verification, check deposits)

**Neural Networks (NN):**

- Specific ML/DL model architecture: Interconnected layers of nodes that process information; foundation of deep learning
- Example in finance: Stock price prediction models using historical market data

**Relationship:** AI ⊃ ML ⊃ DL; Neural Networks are the building blocks of DL

### **Answer 46:** **B** - A model that performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data (the model has "memorized" rather than "learned" patterns)

### **Answer 47:**

**Look-ahead bias** occurs when a model uses information in training that would not have been available at the time a prediction would have been made in practice.

**Example in trading strategy:**
Suppose you're building a model to predict which stocks will outperform in January based on December data.

**Look-ahead bias occurs if:**

- You include the stock's actual January returns as a feature in the model
- You use year-end financial statements that weren't published until March
- You use end-of-day closing prices to predict intraday movements
- You include survivorship-biased data (only stocks that didn't go bankrupt)

**Example: Stock Return Prediction Model**

- **Biased approach:** Use Friday's closing price and Monday's earnings announcement (made after market close Friday) to predict Monday's return
- **Problem:** The earnings announcement wasn't public information when Friday's closing price was set

**Why it's problematic:**

1. **False performance:** Model appears highly accurate in backtesting but fails in real trading
2. **Misleading insights:** Generates strategies that can't be implemented profitably
3. **Capital loss:** Investors may lose money deploying strategies based on biased models
4. **Academic validity:** Undermines research conclusions about market predictability

**Detection:** Model shows suspiciously high out-of-sample performance or very low error; feature importance analysis reveals future information being used

### **Answer 48:** **B** - Low replicability and potential for hallucinations (generating false but plausible-sounding information)


***

## **SECTION 13: DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION**

### **Answer 49:**

**Digital Transformation** in financial services refers to the fundamental reshaping of business operations, processes, and customer experiences through the strategic adoption of digital technologies.

**Three key dimensions with examples:**

1. **Customer Experience:**
    - Transformation: Moving from branch-based to mobile-first digital channels; personalized services through AI
    - Example: Mobile banking apps with features like instant balance checks, peer-to-peer payments, AI chatbots for customer service, personalized product recommendations
    - Impact: 24/7 accessibility, convenience, faster service
2. **Operational Processes:**
    - Transformation: Automating manual processes; using AI for decision-making; cloud-based infrastructure
    - Example: Automated loan underwriting using ML algorithms; robotic process automation (RPA) for back-office operations; blockchain for settlement
    - Impact: Reduced costs, faster processing, fewer errors, scalability
3. **Business Models:**
    - Transformation: Creating new value propositions; platform-based models; ecosystem partnerships
    - Example: Banks offering marketplace lending platforms; insurance companies using telematics for usage-based pricing; embedded finance (financial services integrated into non-financial platforms)
    - Impact: New revenue streams, competitive differentiation, customer lock-in

### **Answer 50:**

**Three challenges traditional financial institutions face:**

1. **Legacy IT Systems:**
    - Decades-old core banking systems (mainframes, COBOL code)
    - Difficult and expensive to replace or integrate with modern technology
    - Technical debt accumulation
    - Risk of system failures during migration
    - **Impact:** Slow innovation, high maintenance costs, integration challenges
2. **Organizational Culture and Mindset:**
    - Risk-averse culture focused on compliance over innovation
    - Siloed organizational structure resists cross-functional collaboration
    - Lack of digital skills and talent
    - Resistance to change from employees
    - **Impact:** Slow decision-making, difficulty attracting tech talent, innovation bottlenecks
3. **Regulatory Constraints:**
    - Heavy compliance requirements for data protection, capital adequacy, anti-money laundering
    - Regulatory uncertainty around new technologies
    - Geographic licensing requirements limit flexibility
    - **Impact:** Limits experimentation, increases cost of innovation, creates competitive disadvantage vs. less-regulated FinTechs

(Other acceptable challenges: Cost of transformation, cybersecurity risks, customer trust in digital channels, branch network transition, competition from FinTechs, data quality issues)

### **Answer 51:** **B** - Removing traditional intermediaries by enabling direct connections between parties (e.g., P2P lending bypassing banks)

### **Answer 52:**

**How data analytics and AI contribute to digital transformation:**

**Two use cases:**

1. **Credit Risk Assessment:**
    - **How it works:** ML algorithms analyze vast amounts of data (traditional credit bureau data + alternative data like cash flow patterns, social media) to predict default probability
    - **Value for institutions:** More accurate risk assessment, faster loan decisions, ability to serve previously unbanked customers, reduced loan losses
    - **Value for customers:** Faster approval times, access to credit for thin-file borrowers, potentially better rates for creditworthy individuals
2. **Fraud Detection:**
    - **How it works:** Real-time AI systems analyze transaction patterns, detect anomalies, and flag suspicious activity using behavioral analytics
    - **Value for institutions:** Reduced fraud losses, lower investigation costs, improved compliance, better customer protection
    - **Value for customers:** Enhanced security, fewer false positives (legitimate transactions blocked), peace of mind, immediate alerts

(Other acceptable use cases: Personalized product recommendations, robo-advisory, chatbot customer service, algorithmic trading, insurance underwriting, anti-money laundering, customer churn prediction, dynamic pricing)
